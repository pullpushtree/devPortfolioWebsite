            <p>
              As a creative left-handed youth, I learned early that I had a
              talent for drawing but it wasn't until later when I learned Corel
              Draw, CS6 Illustrator and Photoshop on my own did I really fall in
              love with Graphic Designs. It was around that time I started to
              experiment with Dreamweaver and HTML.

            <p>In early 2000's, Toronto was affected by a series of youth gun 
              violence and that is when I thought I would create a website 
              to highlight young role-models around me. I started with popular 
              CMS and the in this process, I began to learn Angular JS and Ionic v1.

              While I officially started to learn how to properly code, I was

              Shortly after graduating, I spent 3 years working on an ASP.NET

              implementing features from the Front-end to the Back-end using 
              C#, VB.NET, T-SQL and SQL Server. There, I managed and 
              troubleshooted web servers, work with REST APIs, tested and 
              reviewed codes.
